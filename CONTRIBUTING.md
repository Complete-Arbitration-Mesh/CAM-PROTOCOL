   cd complete-arbitration-mesh
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Create a new branch for your changes from the `features` branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name features
   ```

### Making Changes

1. Make your changes to the codebase.
2. Add tests for your changes.
3. Run the tests to ensure they pass:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
4. Run the linter to ensure your code follows our style guide:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```
5. Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message:

   git commit -m "Add feature: your feature description"
   ```

### Submitting a Pull Request

2. Go to the original repository on GitHub and create a pull request.
3. Fill out the pull request template with details about your changes.
4. Wait for a maintainer to review your pull request.

## Branching Policy

We maintain a small set of long‑lived branches:

- `main` – stable, production-ready code.
- `development` – integration branch for the next release cycle.
- `features` – base branch for feature development. Create your feature branches from here and open pull requests against `features`.
- `hotfix` – optional branch for urgent patches that also merge back into `main` and `development`.

Old remote branches should be cleaned up so only these branches remain active.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep pull requests focused on a single feature or bug fix.
- Update documentation if your changes affect it.
- Add tests for new features or bug fixes.
- Ensure your code passes all tests and linting.
- Follow the existing code style.
- Reference related issues in your pull request description.

## Testing Guidelines

- Write unit tests for all new code.
- Ensure existing tests continue to pass.
- Aim for high test coverage.
- Include integration tests for complex features.

## Documentation Guidelines

- Use clear, concise language.
- Include code examples where appropriate.
- Follow Markdown formatting conventions.
- Update API documentation for any changes to the public API.

## Code Style Guidelines

We follow a consistent code style throughout the project:

- Use TypeScript for all new code.
- Follow the ESLint configuration provided in the repository.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Add comments for complex logic.
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility.

## Versioning

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) for releases:

- MAJOR version for incompatible API changes
- MINOR version for backwards-compatible functionality additions
- PATCH version for backwards-compatible bug fixes
